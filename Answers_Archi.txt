ANS 1 :

	Arbitration is a procedure in which a dispute is submitted, by agreement of the parties, 
	to one or more arbitrators who make a binding decision on the dispute. In choosing arbitration, 
	the parties opt for a private dispute resolution procedure instead of going to court.
	Its principal characteristics are:
	
	- Arbitration is consensual
	Arbitration can only take place if both parties have agreed to it. In the case of future 
	disputes arising under a contract, the parties insert an arbitration clause in the relevant 
	contract. An existing dispute can be referred to arbitration by means of a submission agreement 
	between the parties.
	
	- The parties choose the arbitrator(s)
	The WIPO Rules specifically protect the confidentiality of the existence of the arbitration, 
	any disclosures made during that procedure, and the award. In certain circumstances, 
	the WIPO Rules allow a party to restrict access to trade secrets or other confidential 
	information that is submitted to the arbitral tribunal or to a confidentiality advisor 
	to the tribunal.
	
	- The decision of the arbitral tribunal is final and easy to enforce
	Under the WIPO Rules, the parties agree to carry out the decision of the arbitral tribunal
	without delay. International awards are enforced by national courts under the New York Convention, 
	which permits them to be set aside only in very limited circumstances.

		Advantages of arbitration over traditional litigation is followed:
		1. Litigation involves multiple court proceedings under different laws of different countries, 
		   and the results are always conflicting whereas arbitration procedure involves the decision on 
		   merits of the case and only the law that is applied by the common consensus of both the parties.
		   The arbitrating body is not bound to follow a specific procedure and they can formulate their 
		   own procedures. 
		2. Most of the honourable judges in majority of the countries of the world are not young and such
		   positions are only given to the people having relevant expertise in their field. Therefore the
		   judges in litigation might not have the required expertise in the field. Whereas, in 
		   arbitration, the parties can choose their arbitrator and hence only such a person is chosen 
		   as arbitrator who satisfies both the parties equally.
		3. Considering the factor of urgency, where on one hand the litigation procedure goes on with 
		   the classic procedure of the courts which they are bound to follow in case of any of the 
		   disputes are mostly lengthy and tedious and run into generations. The result of such a delay 
		   in justice would not yield proper justice to the aggrieved but in the case of arbitration, 
		   the arbitrators as well as the parties are at the option to shorten the procedure or 
		   elongate it for proper discussion as how and when they like. Arbitration would also be 
		   available with the option of interim relief to the aggrieved parties, which might not be 
		   binding on the parties. They can at any time go to the court to seek any such remedy.
		4. The litigation procedure is never final unless the apex court of the country passes such orders 
		   either in favour or against. In the case of arbitration, there is a limited or no appeal option 
		   which can be waived off at the option of parties. 
		5. The litigation proceedings of any case, except otherwise stated by law, are to take place 
		   publically, which also involves the narration of facts as well as the property description 
		   over which the dispute is required to be settled.This would make the secrets public and would
		   result in huge loss of Intellectual Property to the aggrieved. Therefore, to ensure the 
		   confidentiality and trade secrets of the parties, and also to secure the reputation of them, 
		   the arbitration can be done in closed curtains and the proceedings as well as the awards can 
		   be made confidentially.
		   

ANS 3 :
		
		The arbitration award
			- is the decision made by arbitrators, which
			- solves claims of the parties,
			- provisionally or finally. 
		It may determine
			-legal or
			- factual disputed questions or
			- rights and obligations of the parties.
			
		The final award in merit is binding and has res judicata effect among the parties,which means 
		that the already decided mater cannot be arbitrated again. 
		
		 Arbitral awards may be divided into:
			- the award on merit,
			- the partial award, sometimes embellished with the interim award,
			- the default award,
			- the award on agreed terms,
			- the additional award. 
			
		Awards issued in most of the major arbitration centres of the world are enforceable in India. 
		Part II of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, which governs enforcement of foreign awards in
		India, applies only to awards issued in jurisdictions notified by the Indian government as 
		jurisdictions in which the New York Convention applies. The government has notified all key 
		centres of international arbitration, including France, the United Kingdom, China, Singapore, 
		Sweden, Switzerland and the United States.
